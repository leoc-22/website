# Astro vs Other Static Site Generators: Why I Chose Astro

When it came time to rebuild my personal website, I evaluated several popular static site generators. After testing Next.js, Gatsby, 11ty, and Astro, I chose Astro for this blog. Here's why.

## The Contenders

### Next.js
- **Pros**: Excellent React ecosystem, great developer experience, powerful features
- **Cons**: Can be overkill for static sites, larger bundle sizes, more complex setup

### Gatsby
- **Pros**: Rich plugin ecosystem, GraphQL data layer, strong community
- **Cons**: Complex build times, learning curve for GraphQL, over-engineered for simple blogs

### 11ty (Eleventy)
- **Pros**: Fast builds, flexible templating, minimal JavaScript
- **Cons**: Less modern tooling, steeper learning curve for complex features

## Why Astro Won

### 1. Zero JavaScript by Default
Astro ships zero JavaScript to the client by default. This means faster loading times and better performance metrics:

```astro
---
// This runs at build time, not in the browser
const posts = await Astro.glob('../content/blog/*.md');
---
<h1>My Blog Posts</h1>
{posts.map(post => (
  <article>
    <h2>{post.frontmatter.title}</h2>
    <p>{post.frontmatter.description}</p>
  </article>
))}
```

### 2. Component Islands Architecture
When you do need interactivity, Astro's islands architecture lets you hydrate components individually:

```astro
---
import InteractiveButton from '../components/InteractiveButton.jsx';
---
<h1>Static Content</h1>
<p>This paragraph is static</p>
<!-- Only this button gets JavaScript -->
<InteractiveButton client:load />
<p>This paragraph is also static</p>
```

### 3. Framework Agnostic
You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other frameworkâ€”even mix them in the same project:

```astro
---
import ReactComponent from '../components/ReactCounter.jsx';
import VueComponent from '../components/VueCounter.vue';
import SvelteComponent from '../components/SvelteCounter.svelte';
---
<ReactComponent client:visible />
<VueComponent client:idle />
<SvelteComponent client:media="(max-width: 768px)" />
```

### 4. Built-in TypeScript Support
Astro has excellent TypeScript support out of the box, with type checking for frontmatter and components:

```astro
---
interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

const { title, description } = Astro.props as Props;
---
<h1>{title}</h1>
{description && <p>{description}</p>}
```

### 5. Content Collections
Astro's content collections provide type-safe frontmatter and easy content management:

```typescript
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
});

export const collections = {
  blog: blogCollection,
};
```

## Performance Comparison

In my testing, Astro consistently produced the smallest bundle sizes and fastest loading times:

- **Astro**: ~15KB initial bundle
- **Next.js**: ~85KB initial bundle  
- **Gatsby**: ~120KB initial bundle

## Developer Experience

Astro's developer experience is exceptional:
- Fast dev server with HMR
- Excellent error messages
- Built-in optimizations (image optimization, CSS bundling)
- Flexible file-based routing

## Conclusion

For static sites and blogs, Astro hits the sweet spot of developer experience and performance. It lets you use modern development practices while shipping minimal JavaScript to users.

While Next.js and Gatsby are excellent for complex applications, Astro's simplicity and performance make it ideal for content-focused sites like personal blogs and marketing pages.

If you're building a static site, I highly recommend giving Astro a try.
